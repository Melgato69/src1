    <div>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and White South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

        In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and Chief Engineer. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
        
        Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized controversial statements. In 2018, he was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreeing to limitations on his Twitter usage. In 2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. Musk has also been criticized for spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public transport. Childhood and family
        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[9] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[10][11][12] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a White South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[13][14] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia;[16][17][18] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[19][20] When Musk was a child, his adenoids were removed because doctors suspected that he was deaf, but his mother later decided that he was thinking "in another world."[21] The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".[14][22] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[19] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[23] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[23] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[16][24] Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.[25]
        
        Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[26][27] He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[28][29] An awkward and introverted child,[30] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[23][31] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[32]

        Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[33] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[34][35] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[36] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[37] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[38] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[39][40] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[41][42][43][44]
        
        In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[45] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[46] Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[34] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.[47]

        In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.[23] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[48] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[49] Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. When he and Kimbal could not agree on business decisions, they settled their differences through wrestling.[50] According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[48] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[51] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[52] Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin,[53] were thwarted by the board.[54] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[55][56] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[57][58]</div>
