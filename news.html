        Musk is an active user of the social media platform Twitter and has over 80 million followers.[251] On January 31, 2022, Musk began steadily buying significant quantities of shares in the company, reaching a 5% stake in the company on March 14, 2022.[252] Musk reached a total of 73,115,038 shares on April 1, 9.13% of Twitter's overall shares, valued at the time at $2.64 billion, making him the largest shareholder in the company. Musk neglected to notify the SEC within 10 days of when his stake in the company surpassed 5%, a violation of US securities laws.[253] When Musk publicly disclosed his investment in a Securities and Exchange Commission 13G filing on April 4, 2022, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday surge since its IPO in 2013 as a flurry of trading activity resulted in the share price increasing by as much as 27%.[251] The revelation that Musk had acquired a significant stake in Twitter followed Musk's tweets on March 25 and 26 in which he questioned Twitter's commitment to freedom of speech[254] and said that he was considering developing a rival social media site,[255][256][257] although the comments were made after he had already acquired 7.5% of the company.[252][258]
        
        On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would see him appointed to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company,[259][260] but Musk decided not to join the board before his appointment became effective on April 9.[261] On April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share. In a letter to Twitter's board, he indicated his desire to take the company private: "[Twitter] will neither thrive nor serve [its free speech] societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."[262][263][264] In response, Twitter's board adopted a shareholder rights plan to make it significantly more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without approval of the board.[265]</div>
